                            <code>todolist</code> is an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app where I've deliberately taken a tactical approach with no unit tests and asynchronous JavaScript assisted by ChatGPT.

                           Inspired by a planner book that I was using, todolist quickly supplanted that planner, and has become my home base with checklists, goals, progress notes, and project development planning features.
